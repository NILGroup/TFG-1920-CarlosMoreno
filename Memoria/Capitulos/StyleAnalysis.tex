\chapter{Style feature analysis}

\chapterquote{``Data! data! data!'' he cried impatiently. ``I can't make bricks without clay.''}{The adventure of the Copper Beeches\\Arthur Conan Doyle (1892)}

Of all the style markers used, our goal is to determine which ones vary and differ depending on the recipient of the message. With this in mind, in this chapter we are going to analyse the resulting values of measuring each message with the previously explained system.

The first step in our analysis is to prepare the data. We have to categorise the different contacts depending on its relationship with the sender, choose the features that we are going to study and modify its values in order to have the data ready for being analysed. All of this is explained in Section \ref{sect:DatPrep}.
