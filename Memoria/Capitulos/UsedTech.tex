\chapterquote{We've arranged a global civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology. We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster. We might get away with it for a while, but sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces.}{The Demon - Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark\\Carl Sagan (1995)}

Once we have studied the state of the art, we will explore the different technological tools that we will need in the implementation of our work. As our work is focused on the texts of the e-mails, it will be necessary to study in detail the Gmail API and the functions it provides us with to carry out the different operations (see Section \ref{sect:gmailapitech}). Then, a syntactic analyser will be required in order to measure the style of the documents, that is to say, to be able to apply stylometric techniques. For this purpose, we have chosen spaCy (see Section \ref{sect:spacy}). We will also need a framework to develop the different web services we will implement, a task for which we will make use of Flask (see Section \ref{sect:flask}). Finally, we will explain the database system that we are going to use for the storage of the different data (see Section \ref{sect:mongo}).
