\chapterquote{We've arranged a global civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology. We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster. We might get away with it for a while, but sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces.}{The Demon - Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark\\Carl Sagan (1995)}

Once we have studied the state of the art, we explore the different technological tools that we need in the implementation of our work. As our study is focused on the texts of the e-mails, it is necessary to explain in detail the Gmail API and the functions it provides us to carry out the different operations (see Section \ref{sect:gmailapitech}). Furthermore, a syntactic analyser is required in order to measure the style of the documents, that is to say, to be able to apply stylometric techniques. For this purpose, we have chosen spaCy (see Section \ref{sect:spacy}). We also need a framework to develop the different web services we implement, a task for which we make use of Flask (see Section \ref{sect:flask}). Finally, we explain the database system that we use for the storage of the different data (see Section \ref{sect:mongo}).
