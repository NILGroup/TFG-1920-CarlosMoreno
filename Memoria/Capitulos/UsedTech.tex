\chapterquote{We've arranged a global civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology. We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster. We might get away with it for a while, but sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces.}{The Demon - Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark\\Carl Sagan (1995)}

Once we have studied the state of the art, we explore the different technological tools that we need in the implementation of our work. As our study is focused on the texts of the e-mails, it is necessary to explain in detail the Gmail API and the functions it provides us to carry out the different operations (see Section \ref{sect:gmailapitech}). Furthermore, a syntactic analyser is required in order to measure the style of the documents, that is to say, to be able to apply stylometric techniques. For this purpose, we have chosen spaCy (see Section \ref{sect:spacy}). We also need a framework to develop the different web services we implement, a task for which we make use of Flask (see Section \ref{sect:flask}). Finally, we explain the database system that we use for the storage of the different data (see Section \ref{sect:mongo}).

\section{Conclusions}
In order to be able to extract messages from a user's Gmail account, it is important to know how the user can give us the required permission for being able to accessing to the account's information, and the different operations that we can execute with each of the Gmail API resource. The most important of them are the \textit{get} and \textit{list} methods that labels, messages and threads resource have. The second returns a list of the resource in the user's account and the first returns a specific resource, by giving its identifier.

Once we have extracted the different e-mails, we need a tool for analysing their body (and helping us in the evaluation of the different metrics). For this task, we use the syntactic analyser spaCy. It is able to separate a text into tokens (words, punctuations marks, etc.) and obtain several features of each token, such as its part of speech or its base form.

With these two tools, together with a web service framework as Flask and a database system as MongoDB, we are able to design and implement a system which can extract and analyse the different e-mails of a user account. In the next chapter, we explain how these technologies are integrated in our implementation with the purpose of developing a style analyser.
