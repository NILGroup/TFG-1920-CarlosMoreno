\chapterquote{We've arranged a global civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology. We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster. We might get away with it for a while, but sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces.}{The Demon - Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark\\Carl Sagan (1995)}
