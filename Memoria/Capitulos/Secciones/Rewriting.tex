The rewriting phase will be responsible for modifying the message, obtained by the search phase, as necessary so that it has the style corresponding to the final recipient of the e-mail. To achieve this, we will need to know the category to which the person who will receive the message belongs. For this purpose, we will consult their e-mail address in the database where we can find the classification of the different contacts. In case no information is found about the consulted address, it will be necessary for the user to provide the category to which he or she belongs. As we will explain, this system requires to have previously data (written emails from which their style metrics have been extracted) of the category to which the recipient belongs, which can be a problem in case we consider writing a message destined to a new category.
