\section{Computational stylometry}
This field of Artificial Intelligence (related with the Natural Language Processing and Natural Language Generation) is in charge of studying the writing style in natural language written documents (although it is often use in applications like the detection of plagiarism in programmes). In this section we are going to delve into it in order to known the state of art of this field of study. To achieve this, first a brief introduction is presented (see Section \ref{ssect:introstylo}) and, then, the different applications and techniques used in Computational stylometry are explained (see Section \ref{ssect:techstylo}).

In addition, it will be necessary to explain the presentation of computational stylometry in the specific field of e-mails (see Section \ref{ssect:styloemail}) since, as we can deduce, these present singularities with respect to other types of documents.

Finally, various style writing metrics are going to be explained (see Section \ref{ssect:stymet}) for the purpose of calculating and studying them in the extracted dataset (the entire set of emails that have been extracted).

\subsection{Introduction}\label{ssect:introstylo}
Stylometry \citep{wiki:stylometry} is the application of the study of linguistic style to written language, although it has also been successfully applied to music and painting. It could be defined as the linguistic discipline that applies statistical analysis to literature in order to evaluate the author's style through various quantitative criteria.

Stylometry is characterized by the assumption that there are implicit features in the texts that the author introduces unconsciously, such as the use of a specific vocabulary that makes up the writer's mental lexicon, the lexical-syntactic structure of the sentences in the document, etc \citep{burrows1992computers}.

According to \cite{stylohist}, the stylometry was born in 1851 when Augustus de Morgan, an English logician, hypothesized that the problem of authorship could be addressed by determining whether one text ``does not deal in longer words'' \citep{morganletters} than another. Following this idea, three decades later, the American physicist Thomas Mendenhall carried out research in which he measured the length of several hundred thousand words from the works of Bacon, Marlowe and Shakespeare \citep{mendenhall1887}. However its results showed that word length is not an effective writing style features which allow us to discriminate between different authors. Since then numerous investigations have been carried out to analyse the parameters that define writing style more precisely.

\cite{neuronalstylometry} defines the writing style as ``a set of measurable patterns which may be unique to an author''. For this reason, various machine learning and statistical techniques have been used to discover the characteristics that determine it. One of the first and most famous successes was the resolution of the controversial authorship of twelve of the Federalist Papers. These documents, a total of eighty-five papers, were published anonymously in 1787 to convince the citizens of New York State to ratify the constitution. They are known to have been written by Alexander Hamilton, John Jay and James Madison, who subsequently claimed their contributions from each of them. However, twelve were claimed both Madison and Hamilton. By using the frequency of occurrence of function words, previously used in \cite{juniusletters}, and employing numerical probabilities adjusted by Bayes' theorem, in \cite{federalistpapers} the twelve papers disputed were attributed to James Madison. Thereafter, Federalist Papers is a famous example in this area for testing the different solutions, as it happens in \cite{neuronalstylometry}, which make use of neural networks to solve this problem.

\subsection{Applications and techniques}\label{ssect:techstylo}
In addition to the detection and verification of authorship in historical, literary and even forensic investigations, stylometry is used in other areas such as the detection of fraud and plagiarism, the classification of documents according to their genre or audience, etc. Other possible applications of this area are the prediction of the gender, age or personality of the author as it happens in \cite{schwartz2013personality}; inference of the date of composition of texts, which is known as ``stylochronometry'' \citep{stamou2007stylochronometry, juola2007becoming}; and the natural language generation with Style \citep[Section 5.1]{nlgsoa}.

To address all these problems, mostly statistical techniques are used. Some of them, which are more complex, are more recognized for belonging to the field of machine learning such as neural networks \citep{ng1997feature}, Support Vector Machines \citep{abbasi2005applying}, Principal Components Analysis \citep{PCAstyle}, decision trees \citep{apte1998text}, Adaboost \citep{cheng2011author}, K-Nearest Neighbors \citep{kucukyilmaz2008chat} and Naive Bayes \citep{sahami1998bayesian}; while others are based on purely statistical approaches (such as cusum in \cite{summers1999analysing} or \cite{thisted1987did}) or merely syntactic-statistical concepts as in the well-known software implementations such as stylo \citep{stylor} and STYLENE \citep{stylene}. To this last type also belongs techniques based on dictionary word counting using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count also known as LIWC \citep{liwc2015}, while more recent ones which use simple lexico-syntactic patterns, such as n-grams and part-of-speech (POS) tags \citep{mihalcea2009lie, ott2011finding}, belongs to the machine learning approach. We can also find techniques outside this paradigm, such as the writing style features driven from Context Free Grammar (CFG), as we can observe in \cite{cfgstylo}, genetic algorithms \citep{holmes1995federalist} and Markov chains \citep{tweedie1998variable}.

In order to address our work, we are going to make use of writing style metrics (which will be explained in Section \ref{ssect:stymet}), based on simple statistics like the mean and easy probabilistic metrics like the entropy.

\subsection{Style in emails}\label{ssect:styloemail}
Electronic mails are a very specific type of document in stylometry. Their length, usually shorter, and level of reliability, in most occasion between the informality of spoken word and the relative formality of an official letter, are two of their characteristic that make them so peculiar. For this reason, a lot of researches have focused their attention on these type of texts, taking special interest the identification pertaining to the authorship of e-mail messages such as the published thesis \cite{corney2003analysing} or \cite{thomson2001predicting}, which have investigated the existence of gender-preferential language styles in e-mail communications.

Despite being able to use most of the techniques mentioned above, both the machine learning (such as K-Nearest Neighbors used in \cite{calix2008stylometry} or Support Vector Machines used in \cite{de2001mining}) and the purely statistical approaches (such as regression algorithms used in \cite{iqbal2010mining} for analysing 292 different features in order to verify the email authorship), it is possible to find big differences with other documents such as structural features that pure text lacks. The usage of greeting text, farewell text and the inclusion of a signature are three examples of these structural features that we must to take into account.

Due to e-mail documents have several features which difference from with longer formal text documents (such as literary works or published articles), they make any computational stylometry problem challenging compared with others. First of all, as we have previously said, length of the emails is much shorter than other documents, which results in certain language-based metrics may not being appropriate (such as hapax legomena or hapax dislegomena, that is to say, the number or ratio of words used once or twice, respectively). This e-mail's feature also makes contents profiling based on traditional text document analysis techniques, such as the ``bag-of-words'' representation (for example when Naive Bayes approach is being used) more difficult.

Other electronic mail's particularity is the composition style used in formulating them. That is, an author profile derived from normal text documents (for example published articles) could not be the same as that obtained from a common e-mail document \citep{de2001mining}. For example, the briefness of the e-mails causes a greater tendency to get to the point without excessive detours on the subject, in other words, they have a concise nature. We may also find that they contain a greater number of grammatical errors or even a quick compositional style that is more similar to an oral interaction, as these can become a dialogue between two or more interlocutors. In this way, the authoring composition style and interactivity features attributed to electronic mails shares some elements of both formal writing and speech.

Main feature of e-mail against other type of documents that we are interested in is the variation in the individual style of e-mail messages due to the fact that they, as an informal and fast-paced medium, exhibit variations in an individual's writing styles due to the adaptation to distinct contexts or correspondents \citep{argamon2003style}. Many authors such as \cite{allen1974methods} and \cite{de2001mining} support the hypothesis that each writer has certain unconscious habits when writing an email that depend on the target audience. However, we hardly find any research that uses stylometry to set the parameters of writing style according to the recipient of the message.

\subsection{Style metrics}\label{ssect:stymet}

According to \cite{rudman1997state}, at least a thousand stylistic features have been proposed in stylometric research. However, there is no agreement among researchers regarding which ``style markers'' yield the best results. \cite{chen2011authorship} (150 stylistic features were extracted from e-mail messages for authorship verification), \cite{gruner2005tool} (sixty-two stylometric measurements applied to pairs of text were calculated and then analysing in order to detect plagiarism in text documents) and \cite{canales2011stylometry} (82 stylistic features extracted from sample exam documents were analysed using a K-Nearest Neighbours classifier for the purpose of authenticating online test takers) are only 3 examples of a large list of researches which look for appropriate writing style metrics to carry out their work.

As \cite{brocardo2013authorship} indicate, analysing a huge number of features does not necessarily provide the best results, as some features provide very little or no predictive information. And, as \cite{brocardo2013authorship} do, our approach is to build on previous works by identifying and keeping only the most discriminating features.

According to \cite{abbasi2008writeprints} existing stylistic features can be categorized as lexical, syntatic, structural, content-specific and idiosyncratic style markers. However, this is not the only existing classification. There are many others like the one proposed by \cite{corney2001identifying} (184 stylometric measurements were calculated and analysing by using a Support Vector Machine learning method in order to identify the authorship en electronic mails), in which we see how features are divided as character-based, word-based, document-based, function word frequency distribution and word length frequency distribution; or the one proposed by \cite{cfgstylo} which use a more simple classification of features in words, shallow syntax and deep syntax. As in our case we have used 31 lexical-syntactic features (due to previous studies, such as \cite{homem2011authorship}, yield encouraging results with lexical features), following the classification of \cite{abbasi2008writeprints}, we will now divide them into 4 categories in which we have grouped them according to their usefulness in terms of what type of conclusions we can infer from each of them. These categories are: part of speech features (see Section \ref{sssect:posf}), punctuation features (see Section \ref{sssect:punctf}), vocabulary features (see Section \ref{sssect:vocabf}) and structural features (see Section \ref{sssect:strucf}). We must not confuse this latter category (which it belongs to the lexical features of the classification given in \cite{abbasi2008writeprints}) with the structural metrics explained in \cite{abbasi2008writeprints}.

Finally, in this Section, we are going to study other popular metrics which are not used in this work (see Section \ref{sssect:unusedf}). Some of then are going to belong to the structural, content-specific and idiosyncratic style markers of \cite{abbasi2008writeprints}, and the others are going to complete the categories to which the explained metrics belong (lexical and syntatic).
