After analysing the metrics that define the style of the e-mails based on its recipient, we are able to design a system that takes advantage of this knowledge and generates messages according to what we learnt. In this chapter we will explain a proposal for this system with which the user can obtain a text just by providing some keywords related with the topic of the desired e-mail and its recipient. With this in mind, we are going to detail the different phases of our model and its general architecture (see Section \ref{sect:phasemod}). Then, each one of its tasks are going to be explained: searching phase (see Section \ref{sect:searchemail}) and rewriting phase (see Section \ref{sect:transemail}).
