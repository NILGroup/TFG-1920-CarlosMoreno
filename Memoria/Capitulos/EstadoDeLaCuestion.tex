In order to be able to develop a model for stylometric analysis of e-mails for recipient-based personalised writing, the first thing we need to understand is the fundamentals of this communication method. For this reason, in Section \ref{sect:email}, we delve into both the protocols that define it and the specific structure of the Gmail service, since the e-mail account that we analyse and that is used to design the model around the data extracted from it belongs to that service.

Once we have laid the foundations of communication through e-mail and, specifically, the Gmail service, we study how to analyse the wording of the different messages, that is to say, we learn the concepts of the field of study known as stylometry (see Section \ref{sect:compstyl}). Specifically, we also present the research related to e-mails and the most common techniques and metrics used for various purposes.

Finally, for the modelling of a recipient-based custom writing system, we need to understand the functioning of a very popular technique in information retrieval called Latent Semantic Indexing. For this reason, in section \ref{sect:lsi}, we explain this method in detail, which is used in later chapters.
