In order to be able to develop a model for stylometric analysis of e-mails for recipient-based personalised writing, the first thing we need to understand is the fundamentals of this communication method. For this reason, in Section \ref{sect:email}, we will delve into both the protocols that define it and the specific structure of the Gmail service, since the e-mail account that we will analyse and that will be used to design the model around the data extracted from it belongs to that service.

Once we have laid the foundations of communication through e-mail and, specifically, the Gmail service, we will study how to analyse the wording of the different messages, that is, we will learn the concepts of the field of study known as stylometry (see Section \ref{sect:compstyl}). Specifically, we will also present the research related to emails and the most common techniques and metrics used for various purposes.

Finally, for the modelling of a recipient-based custom writing system, we will need to understand the functioning of a very popular technique in information retrieval called Latent Semantic Indexing. For this reason, in section \ref{sect:lsi}, we will explain this method in detail, which will be used in later chapters.
