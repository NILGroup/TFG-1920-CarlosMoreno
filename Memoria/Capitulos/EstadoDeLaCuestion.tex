\section{Electronic Mail Protocols}
Apart from Gmail API (see section \ref{sect:gmailapi}), there is another way to read, send emails and access to the user's email data and this is by directly using the communication protocol for electronic mail transmission and the internet standard protocol to retrieve email messages from a mail server over a TCP/IP connection. In this section we are going to study the main email management protocols, both electronic mail transmission protocol (such as Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, which is explained in section \ref{ssect:smtp}) and message access protocol (such as Internet Message Access Protocol and Post Office Protocol, which are studied in sections \ref{ssect:imap} and \ref{ssect:pop}, respectively).

In spite of being a mail server-independent solution, as we will see, we are going to find security issues which are going to hinder our user's email data access. These trials come from the automatic server access. The assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of making use of the email protocols or the Gmail API is discussed in section \ref{ssect:protvsapi}.

\subsection{Simple Mail Transfer Protocol} \label{ssect:smtp}
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (also known as SMTP) is a network protocol used for the exchange of e-mail messages. It was originally defined in \cite{rfc821} (for the transfer) and in \cite{rfc822} (for the message). It is currently defined in \cite{rfc5321} and \cite{rfc5322}.
