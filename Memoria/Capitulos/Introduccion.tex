Smartphone development meant not only a technological advance but a social revolution too. This intelligent telephones have brought with them countless paradigm shifts in terms of the social sphere. Since then, we are able to speak of a new model of human relationship both between people and with our technology. This current relation standard is due to the easy and quick way of accessing the different information that our mobile devices provide us. Long waits (nowadays the meaning of ``long'' waits has changed too, people consider more than two or three second too much time) for obtaining anything such as accessing to a website or showing any operation result, are excessively tedious and could be even frustrating for some smartphone users. When we are using our mobile, we want, as fast as possible, the information we are looking for. Precisely because of this, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) becomes a very important part in the process of development of most applications, not only in terms of speed of response and efficiency of algorithms, but also in how we show different information and the easiness for obtaining it.

As for the relationships between people, as we have said, they have dramatically changed. There is no doubt that the main driving technologies behind this transformation of our relational paradigm are the social networks and the instant messaging. Focusing on the latter, it is necessary to make a breakdown of what consequences to our interpersonal interaction the instant communication have brought with itself. Just as it happens with the HCI, easiness and speed are probably the first features we look for when we are going to send or receive any information to anybody. If we also expect a reply, the ideal would be to obtain it as quickly as possible. Therefore, in most of occasions, in practice we are looking for an ``automatic'' response from a human, what practically implies that everyone is ``obligated'' to be connected at any time with the answer we are asking for prepared. This new insight into the relationships between people, that perceives the humans as servers who send a request waiting for a quickly reply with the expected data, has promoted a very fast sending of short messages which intends to substitute and simulate an spoken conversation. These little texts are often concise and summarised, and they form an atomic semantic unit, namely they have their own independent meaning.
